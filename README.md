## **What is WindProtocol?** 

WindProtocol is revolutionising venture capital. Through the use of game theory and economic incentives, the WINDProtocol platform incentivises researchers, startups and investors to share information with one another in a unified network. 

## **What problem does WindProtocol solve?**

The venture capital industry is rife with inefficiencies. Notorious for pushing the boundaries of technological disruption in other industries, VCs have been surprisingly slow to disrupt their own. The result is a colossal waste in human time as a result of task repetition and a misallocation of financial capital.

**Investors waste time meeting startups that don't fit their investment or quality criteria**  
  
The average time taken for a VC to due diligence a deal is 65 hours and only 5% of the deals evaluated are closed. Given the average salaries of partners and associates undertaking the due diligence, this represents a sizeable cost to venture capital firms. 

**Most of the due diligence tasks are repeated by different investors**  
  
In fact, 74% of the tasks undertaken are repeated across different firms, 20% of the tasks are suitable for automation with data products that already exist today and 45% of the research tasks could be comfortably outsourced to specialist 3rd parties to save time and money.  
  
****Below are just a few examples of research and due diligence tasks that are either repetitive, suitable for automation or outsourcing. It is by no means an exhaustive list but merely shown for illustrative purposes.

| Research the industry market size, barriers to entry and growth forecasts | Yes | High | Yes | Partially |

**Significant information gaps exist for both investors and startups** 

Only 5% of meetings between VCs and startups result in an investment offer. This means 95% of these deals  don’t meet the firm’s investment or quality criteria. Why is the rejection so rate high? Why do VCs take meetings in the first place if the company doesn’t meet their investment or quality criteria? The answer lies in information gaps. Much of this information is factual and readily available prior to the first meeting with the startup. Frequently, other investors have already researched the company, market and technology.  As have individuals such as research specialists that cover that sector or management teams of companies in the same industry. Whilst there may be information gaps on an individual and firm level, these are significantly reduced on an industry wide level. The incentive structure for individual participants across different firms to share knowledge has until now limited the dissemination of knowledge to efficiently assess deal flow.  
  
The same information asymmetries that apply to investors evaluating a potential deal apply to founders of Startups evaluating an investor. Which are the best VCs to reach out to for a given startup, industry, geography or technology? Which partners at those VCs are likely to add the most value? The average founder pitches to over 15 individual VCs when they are raising capital. Much of the information collected by respective VCs during this period is fact based and repetitive. As a result, founders often end up repeating answers to the same questions over and over again. The average founder takes over 4 months to close a deal.  
  
These information asymmetries across both startups raising capital and the venture funds investing in them create material inefficiencies, resulting in a gross misallocation of human time and financial capital.  


## **The solution: WindProtocol** 

We propose a working prototype solution that creates economic incentives underpinned through game theory for Startups, Investors, Contributors and Validators \(collectively “Stakeholders”\) to embrace transparency and share information. Each of these parties have a vested economic interest to improve the quality of the WIND database and associated matching algorithms.

At the core of the WIND platform is the WIND database which serves to collect information delivered by each of the Stakeholders. Information generated in this database is then passed through an algorithm to match Startups with Investors in a double opt-in introduction process. Tangential to the filtering and matching process are research capabilities to reduce knowledge gaps and speed up the collection of relevant information. This can be used for deal sourcing, trend spotting, risk management and supporting portfolio companies post-investment.

**Investor & Startup Matchmaking**

The process works as follows:

1. Startups apply to be listed in the WIND Database. Additionally, Contributors acting as deal scouts are incentivized to refer Startups.
2. To maintain deal flow quality standards, Startups are researched and vetted by Contributors and Validators. Incentives for these roles are designed such that they only review categories they are qualified to rate.
3. Relevant research and due diligence tasks are automatically created and distributed to Contributors and Validators according to their TrustScores and likelihood to complete.  
4. Only startups that reach a weighted average rating of 7/10 or greater are made available for Investors as suggested deals.
5. A dynamic data model is then used to match qualifying Startups with Investors. This takes into account Investor preferences including deal stages, industries, business models and geographies as well as a predictive probability model to generate a match.
6. A two-way opt-in matching system is utilised to give both Startups and Investors control over who they wish to be introduced to.
7. Investors will compete for priority access to the top startups through a competitive token staking system.

#### **Outsourced Research & Due Diligence**

In addition to matchmaking deals, WIND also serves as a useful tool for Investors to outsource research and due diligence to the WIND community. Examples of research that Investors may choose to outsource include:

* Obtaining a professional opinion on a Startup they are considering investing in from a top rated Contributor for a given topic;
* Collect feedback from the WIND community on one of their portfolio companies to help improve their product/service
* To outsource low-skilled due diligence work on a potential deal because they want to spend their time on higher value tasks;
* To get a professional opinion and community consensus on a technological trend that may be emerging
* To help decide which of their portfolio companies they should double-down in a future financing round

In order to outsource research, the Investor must incentivise the WIND community by pledging WIND tokens. Ninety-five percent of the amount pledged is paid to the community who undertake the research tasks, whilst five percent is transferred to the WIND platform as a service fee.

The deal matchmaking and custom research portal are seamlessly integrated to provide Investors and Startups with more complete and more trustworthy information. This significantly improves both the quality and speed of the decision making process, freeing up valuable time for both Startups and Investors.

The success of the WIND platform is reliant upon the right technological and economic architecture to facilitate information flow.

**The WindProtocol organisation**  
  
At the core of our philosophy is disinter-mediating the creation and maintenance of information on companies and investors to present a global, unbiased opinion and pulse. The WindProtocol organisation is itself decentralised and was created on Aragon. All major decisions are put to vote on Aragon and only token holders are able to participate. This decentralised governance model helps align incentives amongst token holders and ensures the project is run in a manner that best serves all token holders.

**The WindProtocol Researchers**  
  
WindProtocol makes it possible for everyone in the world to organize the world's information on startups in a structured, trusted and economically incentivised manner. Researchers that apply start off at the same level, building up trust and experience over time. Validation and research activities are then allocated to members according to their skill, experience and TrustScore level. The allocation algorithm is itself open source, ensuring transparency and consensus.

**Our principal focus for WindProtocol researchers include:**
