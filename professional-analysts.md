# Professional Analysts

## How are professional analysts matched with digital currencies and rewarded? 

1. Professional analysts decide which digital currencies they want to analyse. What they choose to write about is influenced by their expertise, total number of WIND tokens staked for a given digital currency and competition from other analysts already covering that currency. 
2. Community members can upvote their preferred analyst reports for a given currency. 
3. The total amount of tokens staked for that report is then distributed  to the top analyst report, determined by number of upvotes.
