# Startups

## **Why it sucks to be a founder \(until now\)**  

The average founder pitches to over 15 investors when they are raising capital for a round and takes over 4 months to close the round. 

Much of the information collected by respective investors during this period is fact based and repetitive. As a result, founders often end up repeating answers to the same investor questions over and over again.   
  
Significant information asymmetries are the principal cause of a time consuming fundraising processes. Some of the more common information asymmetries are:  

* Which are the best Investors to reach out to given my stage and current traction levels? 
* Which are the best Investors to reach out to given the geography of my team location? 
* Which Investors really understand our market? 
* Which partners at investment firms are most likely to be interested in our product and able to add value beyond money? 

## **Raise capital faster & smarter with WIND** 

Wind solves the above problems by allowing founders to raise capital faster and smarter than traditional fundraising marathons. 

We connect Startups directly to Investors that our algorithms think will be a good fit for the startup, saving them considerable time to focus on building their products. Founders and Startup teams can: 

* Discover who the best Investors are for their Startup 
* Only speak to Investors that are already interested in speaking to them

## Get feedback on your product

As part of the application process, the WIND community does a comprehensive analysis of Startups that have applied. We do this for 2 reasons: 

1. We want to make sure that the Startups we show to Investors meet their investment criteria and quality benchmarks 
2. We want to help Startups that apply by giving them tailored feedback that they can use to improve their product 

## What kind of Startups can apply to WIND? 

A Startup in our world means any company that is raising capital. 

**Startups that can apply:** 

* single or multiple founders 
* all stages including angel rounds all the way up to Series D
* all product stages from pre-MVP to scaling
* all geographies, industries, business models and technologies 

**Startups that can't apply:** 

* Lifestyle businesses
* Small potential acquisition prices \(Under US$100m\) 
* Core team members that have too many commercial commitments outside of the startup
* Founders with criminal records or bankruptcy charges

## Will my Startup be accepted? 

Once you have applied, our community of Researchers will analyse your Startup and may contact you to provide additional information if it's missing.  

**Your Startup will need to obtain an average rating of 7/10 or greater in order to be appear as a potential match to Investors.** 

Being accepted on the WIND matching program is a huge compliment to your Startup and shows that the community is behind you.   
  
It also serves to avoid wasting time of both Startup founders and Investors in meetings that won't go anywhere.  
  
Even if your Startup's rating is below 7/10, you still receive valuable feedback from our community of Researchers to improve your product. 

You will be free to re-apply 2 months after the rejection date, should you wish to. 

## Is it free to apply? 

Applying to join WIND as a Startup is free. Analysing your Startup is no small feat and it can take around 3 weeks the Researchers in our community to complete their research.   
  
Startups that are in a rush to raise capital have the option of purchasing WIND to speed up the application process. This ensures that the Startup will be reviewed in 7 days.   
  
The WIND prices for fast-track applications are based on the investment stage. Conducting due diligence on a 1 man Startup that is pre-MVP is usually significantly faster that conducting due diligence on a Startup at a later stage, such as $15m Series B funding round.
