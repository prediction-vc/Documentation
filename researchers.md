## **WIND Researchers**

Wind makes it possible for everyone in the world to organise the world's information on Startups in a structured, trusted and economically incentivised manner. Researchers that apply start off at the same level, building up trust and experience over time. Validation and research activities are then allocated to members according to their skill, experience and TrustyScore level. The allocation algorithm is itself open source, ensuring transparency and consensus.

## **How does the Research engine work?** 

The due diligence research engine provides research bounties and rewards for providing and validating correct information.  Startups will provide the basis for this information during their application process.  The system works as follows: 

1. Startup discloses information.  This information is submitted in a standardized format.
2. Researchers can access this information.  For each piece of information, they can do one of the following:
   1. Ignore
   2. Choose one of three truths to endorse:
      1. Endorse the submission as presented
      2. Write a revision
      3. Endorse an existing revision
3. A revision will consist of a\) the differing piece of information and b\) rationale or source.  These two pieces together will be a bid to convince other contributors that the revision is more accurate.
4. All scores are hidden, however, Researchers with higher TrustyScores may have their revisions displayed higher when there are many revisions to choose from.
5. Score totals are a function of the TrustyScore associated with each endorsement.  
6. After the end of the review period, the total endorsements determine which piece of information is confirmed.
7. If the highest scoring answer is the original submission, it becomes accepted as true

The bounty is divided among users who endorsed, proportional to their TrustyScore

**Table: Impact to TrustyScore when original submission is accepted**

| Endorse original submission | Increase |
| Submit revision that is in the top 2 | No effect |
| Submit revision that is below the top 2 | Decrease |

Half the bounty is given to the author of the winning revision, and the other half is divided among the contributors who upvoted it.
