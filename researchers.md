## **How does the Research engine work?** 

The due diligence research engine provides research bounties and rewards for providing and validating correct information.  Startups will provide the basis for this information during their application process.  The system works as follows: 

1. Company discloses information.  This information is submitted in a standardized format.
2. Contributors can access this information.  For each piece of information, they can do one of the following:
   1. Ignore
   2. Choose one of three truths to endorse:
      1. Endorse the submission as presented
      2. Write a revision
      3. Endorse an existing revision
3. A revision will consist of a\) the differing piece of information and b\) rationale or source.  These two pieces together will be a bid to convince other contributors that the revision is more accurate.
4. All scores are hidden, however, Contributors with higher TrustRatings may have their revisions displayed higher when there are many revisions to choose from.
5. Score totals are a function of the TrustScore associated with each endorsement.  
6. After the end of the review period, the total endorsements determine which piece of information is confirmed.
7. If the highest scoring answer is the original submission, it becomes accepted as true

The bounty is divided among users who endorsed, proportional to their trust score.
