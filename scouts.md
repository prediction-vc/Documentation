# Scouts

The WIND Scout program incentivises thousands of Scouts to recommend the hottest deals before they become oversubscribed.   
  
In return, we offer high economic incentives for Scouts to refer deals to the network. 

Scouts will have a TrustyScore weighted heavily towards their success in bringing quality startups to the platform.  The determinants will be Startup popularity based on Investor interest, overall Startup score, and most importantly, if a Startup receives funding.   

When someone participates on the platform as a Scout, they are eligible to receive a quarterly payment of WIND tokens based on their Scout TrustyScore. The amount of DAI they receive will be based on their TrustyScore and the number of Startups they have brought to the platform in the last quarter. The TrustyScore system will also impact the ability of a Scout to refer a startup. Scouts with low TrustyScores will not be able to refer Startups to the network until their TrustyScore is restored.

## Why should you become a WIND Scout? 

There are numerous benefits to becoming a Scout on WIND. You get to: 

1. Help the founders in your network grow their businesses 
2. Receive DAI payments in accordance with your ability to identify the most promising startups
3. Build your reputation as a talent spotter, paving your way to a career in venture capital or private equity.
