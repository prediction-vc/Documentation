# Scouts

The WIND scout program incentivises thousands of scouts to recommend the hottest deals before they become oversubscribed.   
  
In return, we offer high economic incentives for Scouts to refer deals to the network. The average scout is estimated to earn $7,500 on a successful deal referral.   
  
This represents 50% of the commission that WIND charges on successful deal referrals. 

## What is a successful deal referral? 

When a Startup successfully secures funding from an Investor, they will pay a 5% fee to the platform. This is how we define "Successful deal referral". 

When a Scout refers a Startup to the WIND network, and if that Startup secures funding, the Scout will therefore receive 2.5% of that funding \(50% of the WIND commission\)

## Why should you become a WIND Scout?

1. Earn 2.5% commission on successful deal referrals \(average estimated fee of $7,000 based on a $300,000 investment\)
