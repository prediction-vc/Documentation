# Startup Ratings & Reviews

Startups on WIND are rated and reviewed by Researchers in the WIND community. These Researchers are continuously monitored on their abilities to successfully rate and review Startups. Research tasks to rate and review startups are allocated to Researchers using a sophisticated task matching algorithm that looks at their TrustScores and potential for completing Research tasks successfully.    
  
There are a few core categories that the Researchers evaluate, some of which are common to all Startups and others are context specific, for example "Tokenomics".
