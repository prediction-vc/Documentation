# TrustScore©

## What is the TrustScore©?  

The majority of rating and review sites cannot be trusted due to fake reviews and ratings posted by bad actors - this might include people hired by the startup or malicious competitors.  The WIND TrustScore© solves this trust problem. Members that consistently submit accurate ratings and reviews are financially rewarded for doing so. 

The TrustScore© gives community members a snapshot summary of how much they can trust information provided by another member. Some of the places where you can see the TrustsScore on the platform include: 

* Next to ratings and reviews
* Next to files added to the DataRoom
* On a member's profile page
* On the TrustScore Leaderboard 

It's also used to calculate how much to pay a member for completing a specific task. The higher your Trustscore, the more you get paid. The lower your TrustScore, the lower you get paid. This ensures that members are incentivised to act in a way that increases network value. 

A summary of the TrustScore© creation process is shown below. This system ensures the incentives of the Researchers are directly aligned with increasing utility to Investors.

## How is the TrustScore calculated? 

The TrustScore© is calculated based on measuring two underlying predictive abilities:

1. The ability to predict which Startups an Investor will want to meet;
2. The ability to predict what the overall Researcher community consensus will be. 

### **Ability to predict which Startups an investor will want to meet**

We measure startup popularity based on the number of "meet requests".   

Startup Popularity = Number of meets / Number of passes   
  
We then rank Researchers based on their ability to successfully predict which startups will have the highest popularity.   
  
Example  1: ****Jack gives the startup "A new world" a rating of 9.5/10, which was the highest rating he gave out of the 5 startups he rated. "A new world" turned out to have the highest "Startup Popularity" when presented to Investors. Jack successfully guessed which Startup would be most popular with investors and increased his TrustScore.

### **Ability to predict which Startups an investor will want to meet**

We measure community consensus based on the TrustScore weighted average rating of each rating submitted by a **R**esearcher.   
  
For example, Mary submits a rating of 10/10 for the Startup "A new world". Another 20 Researchers rated "A new world" with a weight adjusted average rating of 4/10. As Mary is 4 points away from the community consensus, her TrustScore is reduced. 

The average rating is not a strict average, but instead weighted by the relative TrustScores of each Researcher.  This means that a Researcher with a demonstrated accuracy level will have their opinion weighted accordingly.

## Impact on Payments

The WIND pool available for rating and reviewing a Startup will be divided into category winners, though a single Researcher could win multiple categories.  

The winners of each category will be paid out the total amount of the bounty, but adjusted for their trust score.  The sum of the trust scores is divided by each individual’s trust score to determine their payout.

Researchers are therefore incentivised to outperform other network participants in order to increase their reputation and wealth.
