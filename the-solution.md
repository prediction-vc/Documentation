# The Solution

We propose a working prototype solution that creates economic incentives underpinned through game theory for Startups, Investors, Researchers and Scouts to embrace transparency and share information. Each of these parties have a vested economic interest to improve the quality of the WIND database and associated matching algorithms.

At the core of the WIND platform is the WIND database which serves to collect information delivered by each of the stakeholders. Information generated in this database is then passed through an algorithm to match Startups with Investors in a double opt-in introduction process. Tangential to the filtering and matching process are research capabilities to reduce knowledge gaps and speed up the collection of relevant information. This can be used for deal sourcing, trend spotting, risk management and supporting portfolio companies post-investment.

**Investor & Startup Matchmaking**

The process works as follows:

1. Startups apply to be listed in the WIND Database. Additionally, Researchers acting as deal scouts are incentivised to refer Startups.
2. To maintain deal flow quality standards, Startups are researched and vetted by Researchers. Incentives for these roles are designed such that they only review categories they are qualified to rate.
3. Relevant research and due diligence tasks are automatically created and distributed to Researchers according to their TrustScores and likelihood to complete.  
4. Only Startups that reach a weighted average rating of 7/10 or greater are made available for Investors as suggested deals.
5. A dynamic data model is then used to match qualifying Startups with Investors. This takes into account Investor preferences including deal stages, industries, business models and geographies as well as a predictive probability model to generate a match.
6. A two-way opt-in matching system is utilised to give both Startups and Investors control over who they wish to be introduced to.
7. Investors will compete for priority access to the top startups through a competitive token staking system.

#### **Outsourced Research & Due Diligence**

In addition to matchmaking deals, WIND also serves as a useful tool for Investors to outsource research and due diligence to the WIND community. Examples of research that Investors may choose to outsource include:

* Competitor analysis
* Market Research
* Technical & Security due diligence 
* Background checks on core team members
* Tokenomics assessments
* Financial modelling reviews

In order to outsource research, the Investor must incentivise the WIND community by spending WIND tokens. Ninety-five percent of the amount spent is paid to Researchers, whilst five percent is transferred to the WIND platform as a service fee.

The deal matchmaking and outsourced research portal are seamlessly integrated to provide Investors and Startups with more complete and more trustworthy information. This significantly improves both the quality and speed of the decision making process, freeing up valuable time for both Startups and Investors.
