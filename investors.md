## How does the investor deal matching work? 

We utilise an algorithmic approach to match investors with deals that fit their investment criteria and quality standards. It works as follows. 

1. Startups get added to the WIND Database - either through direct application or Scout referrals. 
2. To maintain deal flow quality standards, Startups are researched and vetted by the community of Researchers and analysts. Incentives for these roles are designed such that they only review categories they are qualified to rate.
3. Relevant research and due diligence tasks are automatically created and distributed to Researchers according to their TrustScores and likelihood to complete.  
4. Only startups that reach a weighted average rating of 7/10 or greater are made available for Investors as suggested deals.
5. A dynamic data model is then used to match qualifying Startups with Investors. This takes into account Investor preferences including deal stages, industries, business models and geographies as well as a predictive probability model to generate a match.
6. A two-way opt-in matching system is utilised to give both Startups and Investors control over who they wish to be introduced to.

## What other charges are involved?  

Our business model is simple. If we recommend a deal to you that you end up investing in, you pay us 5% commission of the amount you invest.   
  
If the deal was originally brought to the WIND platform by one of our scouts, we split 50% of this commission with them.   
  
We rely on good faith for investors and founders to tell us if a deal did go through. 

## How does Investor Staking work?

Investors have the option of staking the WIND to compete ****for priority access to the top startups through a competitive token staking system. 

The more WIND they stake relative to other investors, the faster they receive the invitations to meet the top rated startups.   
  
Investors that have stake lower amounts or zero WIND run the risk that they may only find out about a top rated deal after other investors have already offered term sheet or have run advanced due diligence, putting them at both a time and information advantage.
