# Investors

## How does the Investor deal matching work? 

We utilise an algorithmic approach to match Investors with deals that fit their investment criteria and quality benchmarks. It works as follows. 

1. Startups get added to the WIND Database - either through direct application or Scout referrals. 
2. To maintain deal flow quality standards, Startups are researched and vetted by the community of Researchers. Incentives for these roles are designed such that they only review categories they are qualified to rate.
3. Relevant research and due diligence tasks are automatically created and distributed to Researchers according to their TrustScores and likelihood to complete.  
4. Only startups that reach a weighted average rating of 7/10 or greater are made available for Investors as suggested deals.
5. A dynamic data model is then used to match qualifying Startups with Investors. This takes into account Investor preferences including deal stages, industries, business models and geographies as well as a predictive probability model to generate a match.
6. A two-way opt-in matching system is utilised to give both Startups and Investors control over who they wish to be introduced to.

## What kind of investors can join WIND?

WIND is primarily targeted at angel investors, angel syndicates, VC funds and private equity funds.   
  
What all our Investors have in common is a: 

* Desire to reduce time wasted on evaluating poor deals
* A need to become more efficient at due diligence and researching opportunities  

## Is it free for Investors to join WIND? 

Any investor can join WIND for free and it can be used to:

* Get access vetted Startup deals that reached at least a 7/10 rating from our community of Researchers
* Outsource certain due diligence tasks such as competition analysis, market research or in depth technical due diligence. 

## What other charges are involved?  

Wind charges an annual rent on staked wallets on a sliding scale from 5-10% based on the amount being staked. This is charged to wallet holders on a monthly basis.   
  
The DAI received from this rent are to cover community operating costs including fund due diligence and referral activities on the platform.

## How does Investor Staking work?

Investors have the option of staking DAI to compete ****for priority access to the top rated Startups through a competitive token staking system. 

The more DAI they stake relative to other Investors, the faster they receive the invitations to meet the top rated Startups.   
  
Investors that stake lower amounts or zero DAI run the risk that they may only find out about a top rated deal after other Investors have already offered a term sheet or have run advanced due diligence. In short, staking DAI gives Investors a timing advantage which often also results in an information advantage.
