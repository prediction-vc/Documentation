# The WIND token

## What is the WIND token? 

The WIND token is an ERC20 compatible token created on Aragon. The **token is used across the platform to:** 

1. Pay users that are carrying out research activities
2. Enable competitive staking for investors to receive priority access to top rated startups  
3. Enable competitive staking for service providers to receive priority access to research tasks 

## **Competitive Staking** 

Competitive staking a pricing technology that allows investors to signal their commitment to funding these top startups.  Investors buy and stake WIND tokens on their platform wallet to vie for position in the ranking. Those who have staked the most will receive access to the best startups first.  When an investor no longer needs or can utilize the leads, they can sell that position to the next investor on an exchange.

If the highest-ranked investors choose to pass on a deal, it is handed to the rank down.  The matching algorithm will assure that the startups are not only highly rated, but also relevant to the particular investor.

**VCs that have had a token balance for a period of 1 year or longer will receive a bonus when calculating their rank.  The bonus will be equal to 8% of the lowest token balance over the previous 365 days.**
