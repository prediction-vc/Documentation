# WIND Token Utility

## What can you do with the WIND token?

The WIND token is an ERC20 compatible token created on Aragon. The **token is used across the platform to:** 

1. Pay Researchers that are carrying out research activities
2. Enable competitive staking for Investors to receive priority access to top rated Startups  
3. Enable competitive staking for service providers to receive priority access to research tasks 

## **Competitive Staking** 

Competitive staking is a pricing technology that allows Investors to signal their commitment to funding these top rated Startups.  Investors buy and stake WIND tokens on their platform wallet to increase their Investor position rank. Investors that staked the most will receive access to the highest rated Startups first.  When an Investor no longer needs or can utilize the leads, they can sell that position to the next Investor on an exchange.

If the highest-ranked Investors choose to pass on a deal, it is handed to the rank down.  The matching algorithm will assure that the Startups are not only highly rated, but also relevant to the particular Investor.
