# General FAQs

## Can I add a digital currency? 

If the digital currency you are interested in is not already listed, you can add it by clicking on the "Submit a Digital Currency" button in the footer. You will then need to complete basic level information about that currency. Once you’re done, an Oroshi administrator will review the currency for approval. If anything is missing, they will reach out to you for more information before it can be published in our directory. 

This ensures basic level information is available on the digital currency but does not include a professional assessment. 

## Can I request to have a professional assessment done on a digital currency?  

Yes. Anyone can stake WIND tokens to request a professional assessment on a digital currency.  

The collective stakes of different community members are then grouped together to create a higher incentive for a professional analyst to apply for the job. 

## Is Oroshi free to use?  

Orasi basic is free to use. It's actually better than free as you can also earn money by using it. One of the great original missions of cryptocurrencies is to democratize wealth and opportunities. The dissemination of knowledge on each of the digital currencies should therefore be available to all, irrespective of wealth.   
  
Orashi premium offers some perks over Orashi basic and is orientated towards professional traders that will pay a premium for early access of information. This includes hedge funds doing algorithmic trading, venture funds investing in early phase blockchain projects and the so called crypto-whales. Oroshi premium users will need WIND tokens to unlock data. Orashi premium helps collect funds in order to redistribute them back to community contributors and validators. 

## What is the WIND token?
