# Algorithmic Token Sale

## What is an algorithmic token sale \(ATS\)? 

An ATS involves selling the token directly through exchanges. This much fairer than ICOs for the following reasons: 

1. It gives everyone the chance to participate 
2. It enables tokens to be released onto the market gradually, in accordance with growth in the organic demand for the token 
3. It helps avoid huge price volatility spikes as a result of a large number of token holders dumping tokens at the same time 

## How many WIND tokens will be sold through the ATS? 

Of the 300 million WIND tokens available, 62.5% of them will be released onto exchanges through the ATS program. Tokens will be released gradually for sale on exchanges in a controlled manner, linked to organic token demand. 

The WIND tokens will be released in "Daily allotments". 

## What is the daily allotment?

The daily allotment is calculated by reference to latest trading volume. The maximum amount of WIND tokens that can be sold on a given day will equate to 6% of the previous day's 24 hour trading volume. 

0.1% of the total supply will be released on the first day of exchange listing to initiate the supply

## **Transparency**

Metrics of the WIND tokens sold through the ATS will be published daily to enhance transparency between the WIND committee and the community.
