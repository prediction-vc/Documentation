# WIND Token Governance

## **The WindProtocol organisation**

At the core of our philosophy is disinter-mediating the creation and maintenance of information on Startups and Investors to present a global, unbiased opinion and pulse. The WindProtocol organisation is itself decentralised and was created on Aragon. All major decisions are put to vote on Aragon and only token holders are able to participate. This decentralised governance model helps align incentives amongst token holders and ensures the project is run in a manner that best serves all token holders.

## What is Aragon? 

[Aragon](https://aragon.org) is a decentralized app on the Ethereum blockchain permitting anyone to create and manage a decentralized organization. The project is open source and led by the Aragon ****Foundation. 

## Why Aragon is used?

Aragon was selected to empower the community to make decentralised concerning the project. The Aragon framework provides a turn-key solution for a secure and tamper-proof network governance layer.   
  
Key decisions of the project are put to community vote on Aragon and only WIND token holders are able to participate in voting decisions. 

The following votes are made on Aragon: 

* Allocations of WIND tokens to be distributed to the community members for knowledge contributions
* Any changes to the outstanding token supply 
* Allocations of WIND tokens to capital raising purposes 
* Allocation of tokens to advisors on the project
* Material allocation \(in excess of 2% of the supply to 3rd party entities or individuals in return for services

## What is the minimum quorum? 

“Min. Quorum” is short for “Minimum Acceptance Quorum. “Min. Quorum” is the number for what percent of the total outstanding supply of tokens must approve a proposal for the vote to be considered valid. 

The Min Quorum for the WIND token is set to 15%. This means that 15% of the outstanding token supply must vote to approve a proposal for the vote to be considered valid. If a vote does not make quorum, then it will fail, even if more tokens voted to approve the proposal than voted against it.

## What is the vote support level? 

“Support” is the number for what percent of the tokens that participated in a vote must approve a proposal for that proposal to pass. 

The WIND support level is set at 60%. This means that at least 60% of tokens that vote on a proposal must approve the proposal for it to pass.

## What is the vote duration?

“Vote Duration” is the length of time that the vote will be open for participation. 

The WIND token vote duration is set to 7 days. This means that token holders have 7 days to participate in the vote. After the 7 days is over, if the vote has not been approved by a majority of tokenholders and/or does not make quorum, then the vote will automatically fail. If the vote makes quorum and receives approval by a majority of tokenholders by the end of the Vote Duration, then the vote will automatically pass.
