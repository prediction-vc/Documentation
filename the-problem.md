# The Problem

## **What problem does WindProtocol solve?**

The venture capital industry is rife with inefficiencies. Notorious for pushing the boundaries of technological disruption in other industries, VCs have been surprisingly slow to disrupt their own. The result is a colossal waste in human time as a result of task repetition and a misallocation of financial capital.

**Investors waste time meeting startups that don't fit their investment or quality criteria**  
The average time taken for a VC to due diligence a deal is 65 hours and only 5% of the deals evaluated are closed. Given the average salaries of partners and associates undertaking the due diligence, this represents a sizeable cost to venture capital firms. 

**Most of the due diligence tasks are repeated by different investors.**   
In fact, 74% of the tasks undertaken are repeated across different firms, 20% of the tasks are suitable for automation with data products that already exist today and 45% of the research tasks could be comfortably outsourced to specialist 3rd parties to save time and money.  
  
****Below are just a few examples of research and due diligence tasks that are either repetitive, suitable for automation or outsourcing. It is by no means an exhaustive list but merely shown for illustrative purposes.

| Validate or research a list of the most direct competitors operating in the market | Yes | Medium | Yes | Partially |
| Research the industry market size, barriers to entry and growth forecasts | Yes | High | Yes | Partially |

**Significant information gaps exist for both investors and startups** 

Only 5% of meetings between VCs and startups result in an investment offer. This means 95% of these deals  don’t meet the firm’s investment or quality criteria. Why is the rejection so rate high? Why do VCs take meetings in the first place if the company doesn’t meet their investment or quality criteria? The answer lies in information gaps. Much of this information is factual and readily available prior to the first meeting with the startup. Frequently, other investors have already researched the company, market and technology.  As have individuals such as research specialists that cover that sector or management teams of companies in the same industry. Whilst there may be information gaps on an individual and firm level, these are significantly reduced on an industry wide level. The incentive structure for individual participants across different firms to share knowledge has until now limited the dissemination of knowledge to efficiently assess deal flow.  
  
The same information asymmetries that apply to investors evaluating a potential deal apply to founders of Startups evaluating an investor. Which are the best VCs to reach out to for a given startup, industry, geography or technology? Which partners at those VCs are likely to add the most value? The average founder pitches to over 15 individual VCs when they are raising capital. Much of the information collected by respective VCs during this period is fact based and repetitive. As a result, founders often end up repeating answers to the same questions over and over again. The average founder takes over 4 months to close a deal.  
  
These information asymmetries across both startups raising capital and the venture funds investing in them create material inefficiencies, resulting in a gross misallocation of human time and financial capital.
