# Trading Competitions

## What are the weekly trading competitions? 

We run a trading competition each week where we give away WIND tokens to the top performing traders. The amount of WIND tokens available to be won by competition winners is agreed upon by the community through an Aragon vote. The agreed amount is also announced in our Telegram channel.

## Do I have to trade with real money? 

No! There is a steep learning curve with cryptocurrency trading so we encourage you not to if youâ€™re just starting out. The Oroshi platform is educational as much as it is practical and you can use it to learn about cryptocurrency trading and try out different trading strategies. 

## How are traders leaderboard scores calculated? 

Traders Leaderboard scores are computed based on the actual or simulated return on investment \(ROI\). This measures the market value of your portfolio relative to the portfolio cost.
